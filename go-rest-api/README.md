## HTTP Server
1. *General Purpose Server:*
    - An HTTP serber is a general-purpose server that listens for incoming HTTP requeasts
      and responds to them.
    - It can handle various types of content, not just data related to the application's state.
2. *Handles Static and Dynamic Content:*
    - An HTTP server can serve both static content (HTML pages, images, etc.) and dynamic
      content generated by server-side programs (like PHP, Node.js, etc.).
3. *No Constraints on Architecture:*
    - HTTP server are not constrained by a specific architectural style or set of principles. 
      They can implement various application architectures.
4. *Stateless:*
    - HTTP is inherently stateless. Each request from a client to the server is independent, 
      and the server doesn't retain information about the state of the client between requests.


## REST API
1. *Specialized for data interaction:*
    - A REST API is a set of rules and conventions for building web services that allow clients
      to interact with data resources.
    - It is more specialized and focused on data exchange and manipulation.
2. *Follows REST Principles:*
    - A REST API follows a set of principles known as REST, which includes statelessness, a
      uniform interface, resource-based architecture, and more.
3. *Resouce-Centric:*
    - REST-APIs are resource-centric, meaming they expose resources (like data objects) and 
      allow clients to perform operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete) on those
      resources.
4. *Uniform Interface:*
    - REST APIs use a uniform and consistent interface, often based on HTTP methoods (GET, POST,
      PUT, DELETE) and standard conventions for representing resources (typically using JSON or
      XML).
5. *Stateless and Stateless Communication:*
    - REST APIs are designed to be stateless. Each request from a client to the server contains
      all the information needed to understand and process the request.
    - Communication between clients and servers is achieved through standard HTTP methods.


## Relationship
- An HTTP server can serve a variety of content, including static files and dynamic responses 
  generated by server-side code.
- When the server exposes an API following REST principles, it becomes a RESTful APi, and 
  clients can use HTTP methods to interact with data resources.

In practice, many web applications use an HTTP server to serve both static content and provide a
RESTful API for dynamic data interaction. The HTTP server handles general-purpose requests, while 
the REST API is used for structured data exchange between the client and the server.
